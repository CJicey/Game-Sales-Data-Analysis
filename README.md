# Game-Sales-Data-Analysis
Importing game sales data from excel and making an organized website as a hub for these sales using Flask.

# Why GameStat?
As a passionate gamer, I envision creating a comprehensive website to track and analyze the market performance of my favorite games. This platform will not only serve my interests but also cater to other gamers and developers who want to stay informed about game trends and reception. The website will feature detailed graphs, raw sales data, gamer ratings, and interactive comment sections. It aims to be a central hub where gamers can share insights and developers can gauge player feedback, fostering a vibrant community centered around video games.
